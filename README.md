# LaboRCCar
This my design for a RC Car that is powered by the Nintendo Switch with the Labo Vehicle Kit and an Arduino UNO. 

This project is an experiment to see what is possible with the Nintendo Labo Joy-Con Garage when used along with an Arduino UNO.  I used this project as an opportunity to try my hand at designing a PCB or the first time.  The Arduino Code, Schematic and Gerber PCB files are available here in case you wish to try this out.

Feel free to use the information here in your own projects!
