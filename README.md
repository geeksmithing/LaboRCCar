# LaboRCCar
This my design for a RC Car that is powered by the Nintendo Switch with the Labo Vehicle Kit and an Arduino UNO. 

This project is an exerpiment to see what is possible with the Nintendo Labo Joy-Con Garage when used along with an Arduino UNO. 
Feel free to use the information here in your own projects.
